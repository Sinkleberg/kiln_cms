  # `Kiln.Plugins` holds the plugin list (via `compile_env`), so it recompiles
  # when the *list* changes — but not when a listed plugin changes what it
  # contributes. The registries baked from it at compile time
  # (`KilnCMS.CMS.TypedBlocks`, `KilnCMS.CMS.FieldTypes`, every content
  # resource's block union) then kept the old `blocks/0`/`field_types/0`: a
  # block added to an installed plugin was in `KilnCMS.Blocks.registry/0` but
  # nested casts treated it as unknown until a `mix compile --force`.
  #
  # A remote call at compile time is a compile dependency (a bare `require` is
  # only an export dependency, which a changed function body never trips), so
  # expanding this in `Kiln.Plugins`'s body makes an edit to a plugin module
  # recompile `Kiln.Plugins` and, through it, those registries.

  # The compiled identity of every module the registries bake from: each

  # it with the digest taken when `Kiln.Plugins` last compiled.
  #
  # The MD5 rather than only the `blocks/0`/`field_types/0` lists: a field
  # added to a dependency plugin's block leaves the lists alone but changes
  # what the core derives from the block at compile time (its storage union
  # member, its GraphQL/JSON:API types). A module that no longer loads
  # (removed, renamed) hashes to a fresh reference, so the answer is
  # "recompile" and the compiler reports the real problem.
