# An edit to a plugin shipped as a Mix dependency must reach the registries the
# core bakes at compile time, with a plain `mix compile` — no `--force` (#1909).
#
# Mix does not track compile-time edges into a dependency's modules, so without
# `Kiln.Plugins.__mix_recompile__?/0` the dependency recompiles and the core
# keeps the old `blocks/0`: the new block is in `KilnCMS.Blocks.registry/0`
# (read at runtime) but not in `KilnCMS.CMS.TypedBlocks`' type table (a module
# attribute, baked at compile time), so a stored one comes back as
# `KilnCMS.Blocks.Custom`. This adds `KilnDepFixture.Ribbon` to the fixture
# plugin's `blocks/0`, recompiles, and asks that table. (Not
# `BlockUnion.subtype_constraints/0`: `Ash.Type.NewType` evaluates its
# constraints at runtime, so it would pass with no recompile at all.)
#
# Run from anywhere, under MIX_ENV=test (the fixture is a `:test` dependency and
# config/test.exs registers it). The fixture file is restored on every exit.
